# Shattered World - Client (WIP)
![](art.png)

Shattered World is an RPG that i develop in my free time

There is A LOT of work to be done to make my dreams come true, but one can always try what is done at the moment (currently nothing) by downloading game [here](https://mirage-a.github.io) and launching downloaded .jar file with Java

And yes, i draw everyfin in Paint ;)

One day i'll complete it :) (if i wont be expelled earlier)
